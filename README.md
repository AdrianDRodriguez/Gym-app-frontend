## General Information
- Why I build this app? Well a lot of the normal people (Including me) struggle to track workouts, find new exercises, or create personalized routines without having to rely on scattered notes or separate apps. This Gym Fitness App centralizes all workout-related activities, helping users stay organized, motivated, and consistent in their fitness journey.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
